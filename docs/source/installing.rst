Installing airspeed velocity
============================

**airspeed velocity** is a standard Python package, based on
``setuptools``, and can be installed using::

    python setup.py install

The requirements should be automatically installed.  If they aren't
installed automatically, for example due to networking restrictions,
the requirements are:

    - `six <http://pythonhosted.org/six/>`_

Optional dependencies, required only to determine machine information:

    - `psutil <https://code.google.com/p/psutil/>`_

    - `numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_

.. todo::
   Checking out from git/tarball/PyPI  etc.
